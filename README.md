### Data Setup: 
For the data setup, we used google colab(https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NTlExhqaiB9hASCAbkQ-BCL3ITSOCbJf?authuser=1#scrollTo=9xYnDbwZiJ95) to sort and parse the data. We only really had to concatenate the data for the nona_data.csv file but for the shirts we had to cleverly utilize pandas to parse and seperate it from the rest of the data. The colab is a little messy but it we used it just to get the data combined together and drop the corrupted or empty data slots. 

### Setup:
In order to setup this project, all you need to do is go to streamlit cloud(https://streamlit.io/cloud) and select your github and choose the repository and what file(app.py) that you want the cloud to run, and that is simply all that needs to be done to setup the dashboard.
